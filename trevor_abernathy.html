THE FOLLOWING IS LITERALLY COPIED FROM SLACK:




JOSH:

The short version is that I imagine him to be ambitious to gain power, but not just of the magical variety. The tower is an old watchtower that the town was originally built around, but was since taken over by the wizard, but it’s actually vacant. The front door (and any opening, such as a window) is actually a portal that opens to a building in a distant land where the wizard lives, studies, and trades. He resides in a great city, which is where he does his business, but anyone who walks in that building thinks they’re still in the tower, which they’re not. Since taking over the tower, he has risen to be the prominent power in the town, which has grown and prospered under his influence.
<br>
His intentions are the continue to deepen his roots and control over the land, and grow the town into a greater city that will have a thriving economy, making him even more wealthy than he already is.
<br>
He deals in rare items and artifacts, often sending adventuring parties out to claim them for him, which he pays them a small fee.
<br>
But even a basic detect magic spell would determine that these objects are all of great power, and that he's simply paying a fraction of what they're worth.
<br>
I figure he's just trying to gain as much wealth and power as possible and essentially attempting to create his own kingdom
<br>
The fact that this is a mainly human-populated town would allow for future enterprises in slavery, as it would be easier to do in a settlement of mostly the same race.
<br>




CHUCK:

Why did he take over this tower in the boonies?  Or does he have many scattered all over and this tower is just one of the portals to his home base?
<br>
Perhaps old folklore telling of some treasure filled ruins in this region?
<br>
I'm just thinking maybe he has some specific motive for this particular location.  A treasure filled ruin, or a powerful artifact left by a powerful hero of the past (Josh: Maybe there's some lost source of power or something. Like something he's read about in some tome that was brought to him. Could be a horde of treasure, like you said, or an artifact of unspeakable power.)
<br>
local legend has almost forgotten about it even
<br>
(Josh: Perhaps a well of rest. Any that drink from it not only are immediately refreshed from weariness, but also regain any abilities they would otherwise need a long rest for Such as spells or anything else. Someone with such a resource would never be vulnerable. Because they would never run out of spells or their own power.)
<br>
and could create magical items to sell with impunity (Josh: Right. Potions and the likeBut extremely diluted. Because if these items were too powerful that were on the market, folks would wonder where the source was. But if they were just really really good and not extraordinary then he could still sell them for a stupid amount of money. I feel like a potion that even revives 3rd level or lower spells would be insanely pricey.)
<br>
maybe an old mithril mine is near the town and he's planning to use that and the well to make magical weapons to sell to multiple kingdoms. warmonger creating an arms race to profit from. 
<br>
(JOSH: He could then incite some sort of tension between two rival nations. Cause the war. Then sell to both sides)
<br>
maybe this guy is a political advisor to some kingdom or other
<br>
I imagine him dressed in a silk suit jacket. He's trained in magic, but realized that true power is that which you have over others, instead of just yourself. So, yeah, absolutely a political advisor in the land that he actually resides in
<br>
Chuck then mentioned how he should basically be Jeffry Irons.
