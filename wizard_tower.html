<b>WIZARD TOWER</b></h1>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The tower appears like a normal, well constructed tower from the
outside.  Within all seems fairly normal as well, to the casual
observer, at least till you starting going up several levels. 
Careful observation may reveal that the inner dimensions don’t
quite seem to match up with the outside.  The tower actually links
multiple towers around the world, sort of stacked atop each other. 
The one in town is the ‘bottom’, going down leads to the basement
and there no further stairs down from there.  Going up, however,
you’ll soon find that you can go up more levels than should fit. 
The levels immediately above the tower the crew has seen so far are
‘in’ a tower in a major city (as yet unnamed) in the same
country.  Levels further up lead to other towers (not yet defined). 
The properties of this tower are the result of an Artifact that
Trevor discovered some time ago.  This is not the primary function of
the Artifact, simply a side-effect or secondary power (full scope of
the Artifact’s power have not been defined).  It seems likely that
Trevor does not know, or at least cannot access the primary powers of
the Artifact at this time.</p>

<p>Unfiltered conversation notes follow:</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>JOSH: So, this tower, I think of it in that once you step foot in
it, you're inside the distant land that he's from. It could be
similar in structure to the tower, so those not thinking much of it
wouldn't assume any different, but anyone who's really keeping track
may be able to tell <br/>
CHUCK: yeah, kind of a 'hey, the tower
didn't look this tall from the outside' kind of thing <br/>
Josh:
Right. <br/>
Exactly <br/>
Once you step foot in the place, and the
door closes, as long as the windows are closed or not in the same
room, you hear nothing of the outside world. It could be a torrential
storm outside <br/>
But once you walk in and the door closes, it's
peaceful and silent (provided the weather in the distant land is
nice) <br/>
The whole place is adorned casually with magical items
<br/>
Carpets that appear as if they were freshly made. Not a single
fiber is amiss, no stains or blemishes. <br/>
You could walk in from
the aforementioned storm with muddy boots and if you looked behind
you, there would be no footprints left behind on those carpets
<br/>
CHUCK: maybe some quiet chittering noises and shuffling from
behind and under things <br/>
but you never see what causes them
<br/>
Josh: The candles wouldn't emit a fine stream of black from the
burned wax (as they never actually burn down). They would burn eerily
still, unwavering. (edited) <br/>
Maybe even casting an unusual
shade, different from the normal yellow-orange glow <br/>
Walking
into the place, you are immediately more comfortable. If it's too
cold outside, you're seemingly warmer. <br/>
Could be that it's from
the environment of the distant land. Could be an enchantment of an
item in the room. Who knows <br/>
CHUCK: just generally otherworldly
and overtly swathed in magic <br/>
Josh: Right. <br/>
But things that
you might not even notice. It's all so convenient, but still passible
by explanation. <br/>
Could be they light fires and there's no draft.
Maybe that's why it's warmer <br/>
CHUCK: oh, and like the first star
trek TNG episode <br/>
Josh: Maybe there's a particular wax from bees
or some other exotic creature that makes the candle <br/>
CHUCK:
there's a bowl of fruit with no apples, but you wanted apples <br/>
and
then you turn back and suddenly there's another bowl full of apples
that you swear wasn't there before <br/>
Josh: Maybe the rugs are
rubbed in the oil from a duck's feathers and slick off moisture and
grime. <br/>
YES. <br/>
I was trying to think of some form of
plate-of-plenty <br/>
But the way you just described it is exactly
what was needed <br/>
Yeah, I think it's important to make everything
possible to explain, but the truth is this guy just has insane wealth
that he has gathered from selling off items of great value, while
keeping even greater ones for himself. <br/>
Anything that you see,
he has something much better in his own quarters <br/>
CHUCK: yeah,
this guy for sure has the Jeremy Irons voice/accent <br/>
greasy and
obsequious, but firm and oddly frightening at the same time <br/>
Josh:
Absolutely. <br/>
There's no wavering. No uncertainty. <br/>
This is
a man of power. <br/>
Hell, the guy probably owns a cravat <br/>
CHUCK:
I want him to have an odd habit or tick. Like, he's forever
straightening his coat, or polishing an unseen spot of his jewelry.
<br/>
Or he twitches when people use poor grammar <br/>
Josh: Oooh, I
like that <br/>
He certainly corrects people <br/>
&quot;There were
less plates than we expected for the reception&quot; <br/>
Fewer
<br/>
There were fewer plates than expected. <br/>
CHUCK: and not
just off-hand corrections <br/>
forceful <br/>
and it obviously
causes him physical discomfort <br/>
Josh: &quot;It's my lord. Not
m'lord. Annunciate when you speak.&quot; <br/>
CHUCK: every yokel
that speaks like the beverly hillbillies might as well just start
punching him in the gut Josh: Oh also, if we ever take over the town,
he could essentially destroy the portal and retreat to safety,
cutting us off from him <br/>
Then there’s a tower just waitin’
for the takin’ <br/>
