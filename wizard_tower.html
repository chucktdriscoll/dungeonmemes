<h1><b>WIZARD TOWER</b></h1>


JOSH: So, this tower, I think of it in that once you step foot in it, you're inside the distant land that he's from. It could be similar in structure to the tower, so those not thinking much of it wouldn't assume any different, but anyone who's really keeping track may be able to tell
<br>
CHUCK:  yeah, kind of a 'hey, the tower didn't look this tall from the outside' kind of thing
<br>
Josh: Right.
<br>
Exactly
<br>
Once you step foot in the place, and the door closes, as long as the windows are closed or not in the same room, you hear nothing of the outside world. It could be a torrential storm outside
<br>
But once you walk in and the door closes, it's peaceful and silent (provided the weather in the distant land is nice)
<br>
The whole place is adorned casually with magical items
<br>
Carpets that appear as if they were freshly made. Not a single fiber is amiss, no stains or blemishes.
<br>
You could walk in from the aforementioned storm with muddy boots and if you looked behind you, there would be no footprints left behind on those carpets
<br>
CHUCK: maybe some quiet chittering noises and shuffling from behind and under things
<br>
but you never see what causes them
<br>
Josh: The candles wouldn't emit a fine stream of black from the burned wax (as they never actually burn down). They would burn eerily still, unwavering. (edited) 
<br>
Maybe even casting an unusual shade, different from the normal yellow-orange glow
<br>
Walking into the place, you are immediately more comfortable. If it's too cold outside, you're seemingly warmer.
<br>
Could be that it's from the environment of the distant land. Could be an enchantment of an item in the room. Who knows
<br>
CHUCK: just generally otherworldly and overtly swathed in magic
<br>
Josh: Right.
<br>
But things that you might not even notice. It's all so convenient, but still passible by explanation.
<br>
Could be they light fires and there's no draft. Maybe that's why it's warmer
<br>
CHUCK: oh, and like the first star trek TNG episode
<br>
Josh: Maybe there's a particular wax from bees or some other exotic creature that makes the candle
<br>
CHUCK: there's a bowl of fruit with no apples, but you wanted apples
<br>
and then you turn back and suddenly there's another bowl full of apples that you swear wasn't there before
<br>
Josh: Maybe the rugs are rubbed in the oil from a duck's feathers and slick off moisture and grime.
<br>
YES.
<br>
I was trying to think of some form of plate-of-plenty
<br>
But the way you just described it is exactly what was needed
<br>
Yeah, I think it's important to make everything possible to explain, but the truth is this guy just has insane wealth that he has gathered from selling off items of great value, while keeping even greater ones for himself.
<br>
Anything that you see, he has something much better in his own quarters
<br>
CHUCK: yeah, this guy for sure has the Jeremy Irons voice/accent
<br>
greasy and obsequious, but firm and oddly frightening at the same time
<br>
Josh: Absolutely.
<br>
There's no wavering. No uncertainty.
<br>
This is a man of power.
<br>
Hell, the guy probably owns a cravat
<br>
CHUCK: I want him to have an odd habit or tick.  Like, he's forever straightening his coat, or polishing an unseen spot of his jewelry.
<br>
Or he twitches when people use poor grammar
<br>
Josh: Oooh, I like that
<br>
He certainly corrects people
<br>
"There were less plates than we expected for the reception"
<br>
Fewer
<br>
There were fewer plates than expected.
<br>
CHUCK: and not just off-hand corrections
<br>
forceful
<br>
and it obviously causes him physical discomfort
<br>
Josh: "It's my lord. Not m'lord. Annunciate when you speak."
<br>
CHUCK: every yokel that speaks like the beverly hillbillies might as well just start punching him in the gut

Josh: Oh also, if we ever take over the town, he could essentially destroy the portal and retreat to safety, cutting us off from him
<br>
Then there’s a tower just waitin’ for the takin’
